// fork() is a function in C that creates a new process (called the child process) from the current process (called the parent process).
// the line at which fork is called , it makes an exact copy of the parent process. Both the parent and child processes start executing from the point where fork() was called.
// In the parent process, fork() returns the child's process ID.In the child process, fork() returns 0.If something goes wrong, fork() returns -1 (indicating an error) 


int main(){
    int x;

    FILE *fd;

    // Returns a positive value in the parent process, which is the child's process ID.

        // Error handling for fork
        printf("Fork failed!\n");
        exit(1);

        // The parent and child processes now execute the same code inside the while(1) loop. Both processes open the file test.txt and append their respective x value to it.

        if(fd == NULL)
        {
            // If file open fails, print error and exit

        // Letâ€™s assume the process ID of the parent process is 1234. The contents of the test.txt file could look like this:1234 0
        // The parent process writes 1234, and the child process writes 0 every 2 seconds.
        fclose(fd);
